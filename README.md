## AUCTIONS

Create an auctions website similar in many ways to Ebay wherein a user can post items they have for sale. All new users to the site start with $1000 which they can use to bid with. Once logged in the home page has a table of all current bid that can accessed leading to details on a separate page. From the details page users can bid on all auctions up to the amount of their remaining funds. After an auction ends, it pays out the proper amount to the auction poster.
